# L'Or√©al AI Augmented Chatbot

## Webapp

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Dev environment

To start developping, you'll need to clone the project

```bash
git clone [ssh_link]

cd loreal-augmented-chatbot/webapp

npm install

#Run the development server:
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) within your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

It also uses the libraries [`shadcn/ui`](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [`radix`](https://www.radix-ui.com/) for the ui components and icons.
